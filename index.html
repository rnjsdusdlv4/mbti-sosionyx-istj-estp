<p align="center"><font face="gabriola">This relationship can be a relationship that maintains an unstable psychological distance. Both types experience difficulties in establishing relationships and maintaining a strong psychological distance. The only way they can be good is when each of them falls apart. They mainly compete for their strengths. Because when they are with others they try to grab their attention by showing their strengths. They may like a part of the other person's traits. And it helps to get closer. But when they work for the same company, their relationship changes dramatically. The person of the inner shape is mainly put on the street, and the relationship becomes warm and becomes formal and cautious. Both begin to regret having overestimated each other. Outgoing partners usually have the false impression that introverted partners deliberately oppose them. This leads to great misunderstandings, and both of them are greatly disappointed. An introverted partner usually condemns them by restraining their outgoing activity and busyness. Because of this, extroverts also accuse people of inward shape in the same way.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="gabriola">The person who is more wounded in this relationship is the outsider. They feel betrayed. As a result, extrovert partners begin to worry too much about their progress, making too much suspicion not to make any mistakes. Unfortunately, extrovert partners do not realize that their inward partners are not as bad as they imagine.</font><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font face="palatino linotype"></font></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font face="palatino linotype"></font></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"></span></p>
